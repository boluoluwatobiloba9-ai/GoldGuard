# GoldGuard

A blockchain-powered platform for transparent and decentralized gold mining operations, ensuring ethical sourcing, fair profit distribution, and environmental accountability.

---

## Overview

GoldGuard leverages blockchain technology to address real-world challenges in the gold mining industry, such as lack of transparency, unethical practices, and inequitable profit sharing. The platform uses four main smart contracts to create a decentralized ecosystem that connects miners, investors, and regulators:

1. **Gold Token Contract** – Issues and manages tokens representing gold assets.
2. **Profit Sharing Contract** – Distributes mining profits among stakeholders.
3. **Compliance Tracking Contract** – Ensures adherence to environmental and ethical standards.
4. **Investment Pool Contract** – Facilitates crowdfunded investments in mining operations.
